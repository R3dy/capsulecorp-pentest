## Errors
OSX on an M1 Mac is giving an error that just says "There was an OVF Tool error".  Trying on an x64 Arch VM

With the exact same config I can't login says error for `root@`  like it's ignoring the hostname.  Noticed Vagrant was 2.3.3  trying update to 2.3.4

after update needed to run

`vagrant plugin expunge --reinstall`

Still getting error `Unable to connect to ESXi host! Error: Authentication failed for user root@`

Noticed other machine had a few more plugins so installed `vagrant-reload` and `vagrant-vmware-desktop`  then go an error about

https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vmware/vagrant-vmware-utility.html

installed it on Arch with

```
yay -S vagrant-vmware-utility
```

now `vagrant status` works!

Needed to install `vagrant-disksize` plugin
